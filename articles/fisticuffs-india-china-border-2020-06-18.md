A series of three brutal battles took place on June 15 in Ladakh's Galwan valley. It seems that Chinese troops had set up an observation post in a position that Indian commanders claimed was in Indian territory. After talks, the Chinese acquiesced and removed the post. According to Indian sources, the camp was set back up on June 14. A colonel named Babu, who was known to be a level-headed and well-respected officer, led a team of men to the post to find out what was going on. Apparently, when they arrived they found Chinese troops they hadn't seen before. It's reported that when Babu tried to engage in conversation with one of them, he was shoved hard and yelled at, prompting the Indian team to bum-rush the Chinese troops and start a full-on brawl with them. It seems the Indian side prevailed and the post was smashed and burned. Babu then reportedly sent his injured men back and called for fresh reinforcements. After that he took the defeated Chinese troops to where he thought the appropriate border was and tossed them back onto their side.

The story then goes that he and his team of men moved on the border a few hours later to find out a little more about the strange turn of circumstances that let to the first melee. According to India Today, some Chinese soldiers were positioned up on a ridge and rained stones down on the Indians, one striking Babu on the head sending him into the river. To his death. This second of three brawls is apparently the one which caused most of the deaths that were reported by the Indian side, over 20. An Indian minister claims that twice that number of Chinese troops were killed, but the Chinese aren't saying much, which is their usual MO. It seems no shots were fired in the three exchanges that took place that night, but the Chinese had employed some brutal weapons, such as 'metal-spiked clubs' and 'barbed-wire-wrapped rods'.

As you'd expect, there's plenty of anger on the Indian side, and there have been protests with people calling for boycotts of Chinese goods. If there's any truth to the claims that Chinese troops have been continuously encroaching on Indian territory, doing things like diverting the Galwan valley river to run on their side of the border, expect India to take a much stronger stance against the Chinese in the disputed territory after this incident.
